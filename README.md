# Machine Learning Personal Loan

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer. The model was built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Jupyter Notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can download the `Machine_Learning_Personal_Loan.ipynb` file from this repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

## Running the Model

To run the model, open the `Machine_Learning_Personal_Loan.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order.
