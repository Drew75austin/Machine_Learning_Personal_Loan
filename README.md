# Machine Learning Personal Loan

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer. The model was built using Python and scikit-learn.


## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer. The model uses a dataset of customer information, including demographic data, financial data, and credit history, to make predictions.

The model was built using Python and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library for Python. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned using pandas, a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

The model was trained using a logistic regression algorithm, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems. The model was evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Jupyter Notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can download the `Machine_Learning_Personal_Loan.ipynb` file from this repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

## Running the Model

To run the model, open the `Machine_Learning_Personal_Loan.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order.
